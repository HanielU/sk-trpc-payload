## How to Use

**MAKE SURE TO RUN `yarn watch` BEFORE `yarn dev`**

`yarn watch` will rebuild your files and reload on any changes

`yarn dev` will rerun your files on any changes.

# Note the following!

In this project, all non payload related TypeScript files should end in .mts to indicate that they are written in TypeScript. However, there are two exceptions to this rule:

1. payload-config.ts: This file should not end in .mts because the payload CLI does not understand payload-config.mts.

2. payload-types.ts: This file should not end in .mts because it is automatically generated by the payload CLI.

Please make sure to follow this naming convention when adding new TypeScript files to the project.
